\*\*🔒 Token Bridge

## Description

The Token Bridge project enables seamless cross-chain token transfers between the Avalanche and BNB networks. It consists of smart contracts, an indexer, and a user-friendly frontend application. This bridge allows users to lock tokens on one network and mint equivalent tokens on the other, facilitating interoperability between the two blockchain ecosystems.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Transfers**: Move tokens effortlessly between Avalanche and BNB networks.
- **Smart Contracts**: Secure and efficient contracts deployed on both networks.
- **Indexer**: Tracks and manages cross-chain transactions.
- **User-Friendly Frontend**: React-based interface for easy interaction.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing transaction volumes.
- **Security**: Implements best practices to ensure safe transactions.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source for transparency and community contributions.

## Project Overview

The Token Bridge project is structured into three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: The BridgeContract.sol handles token 🔒 locking on one network and 🔓 unlocking on the other. Deployed on both Avalanche and BNB networks, these contracts handle the locking and minting of tokens during cross-chain transfers.

2. **Indexer**: A backend service that monitors events on both blockchains, ensuring that transactions are processed correctly and efficiently.

3. **Frontend**: A React-based application that provides users with an intuitive interface to initiate and track their cross-chain token transfers.

## Technologies Used:

**Blockchain**: Avalanche and BNB
**Smart Contracts**: Solidity
**Backend**: Node.js (Indexer)
**Frontend**: React with wagmi

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional blockchains.
- Enhanced security features.
- Improved user experience on the frontend.
- Analytics and reporting tools for transaction history.
