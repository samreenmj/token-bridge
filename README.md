## ðŸ”’ Token Bridge

## Description

The Token Bridge project enables seamless cross-chain token transfers between the Avalanche and BNB networks. It consists of smart contracts, an indexer, and a user-friendly frontend application. This bridge allows users to lock tokens on one network and mint equivalent tokens on the other, facilitating interoperability between the two blockchain ecosystems.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Transfers**: Move tokens effortlessly between Avalanche and BNB networks.
- **Smart Contracts**: Secure and efficient contracts deployed on both networks.
- **Indexer**: Tracks and manages cross-chain transactions.
- **User-Friendly Frontend**: React-based interface for easy interaction.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing transaction volumes.
- **Security**: Implements best practices to ensure safe transactions.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source for transparency and community contributions.

## Project Overview

The Token Bridge project is structured into three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: The BridgeContract.sol handles token ðŸ”’ locking on one network and ðŸ”“ unlocking on the other. Deployed on both Avalanche and BNB networks, these contracts handle the locking and minting of tokens during cross-chain transfers.

2. **Indexer**: A backend service that monitors events on both blockchains, ensuring that transactions are processed correctly and efficiently.

3. **Frontend**: A React-based application that provides users with an intuitive interface to initiate and track their cross-chain token transfers.

## Technologies Used:

- **Blockchain**: Avalanche and BNB
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Backend**: Node.js (Indexer)
- **Frontend**: React with wagmi

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional blockchains.
- Enhanced security features.
- Improved user experience on the frontend.
- Analytics and reporting tools for transaction history.
